Certainly, let's expand on the MIPS architecture document to cover arrays, prefix sums, and binary exponentiation as well.

# MIPS Architecture Overview

## Introduction
MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) is a popular RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture known for its simplicity and efficiency. It is widely used in various applications, including embedded systems, gaming consoles, and more.

## MIPS Registers
MIPS architecture includes 32 general-purpose registers (R0-R31), each 32 bits in size. These registers are used for data manipulation and control flow.

## Instruction Formats
MIPS instructions come in three primary formats:
1. R-Format: Used for arithmetic and logical operations.
2. I-Format: Used for immediate values and memory operations.
3. J-Format: Used for jump instructions.

## Addressing Modes
MIPS supports various addressing modes, including direct, indirect, and indexed addressing.

# MIPS Instruction Set

## Arithmetic Instructions
MIPS provides a wide range of arithmetic instructions, including add, sub, mul, div, and more.

## Logical Instructions
Logical instructions include and, or, xor, and shift operations (sll, srl, etc.).

## Memory Access Instructions
Instructions like lw (load word) and sw (store word) are used for memory access.

## Control Flow Instructions
MIPS offers conditional branches (beq, bne) and unconditional jumps (j, jal) for control flow.

# MIPS Assembly Language

## Assembly Syntax
MIPS assembly language uses a simple and consistent syntax, with mnemonic instructions followed by operands.

## Example Code
```assembly
    addi $t0, $zero, 10     # Load immediate value 10 into $t0
    addi $t1, $zero, 20     # Load immediate value 20 into $t1
    add  $t2, $t0, $t1      # Add $t0 and $t1, store result in $t2
```

## Comments
Comments in MIPS assembly are denoted by `#` and are used for documentation.

# MIPS Exception and Interrupt Handling

## Exception Handling
MIPS architecture provides mechanisms for handling exceptions such as divide-by-zero and overflow.

## Syscalls in MIPS (qtSpim)
qtSpim is a popular MIPS simulator that allows you to interact with the system. Syscalls are used to perform I/O operations and interact with the simulator. Some commonly used syscalls include:
- `li $v0, <syscall_number>`: Load the syscall number into register `$v0`.
- `syscall`: Trigger the syscall based on the value in `$v0`.

Here are some common syscall numbers:
- 1: Print integer
- 4: Print string
- 5: Read integer
- 8: Read string
- 10: Exit

# Working with Arrays in MIPS

## Array Declaration
To declare an array in MIPS, you can use the `.data` section to allocate memory for it.

```assembly
    .data
    my_array: .word 0:100   # Declare an integer array of size 100, initialized with zeros
```

## Accessing Array Elements
You can access array elements by using base address and indexing.

```assembly
    lw $t0, my_array($t1)   # Load the value at my_array[index] into $t0
```

# Prefix Sum in MIPS

## Prefix Sum Algorithm
A prefix sum, or cumulative sum, of an array is a new array where each element is the sum of all preceding elements in the original array.

## Example Code
```assembly
    .data
    my_array: .word 1, 2, 3, 4, 5   # Example array
    .text
    main:
        li $t0, 0                   # Initialize the sum to 0
        li $t1, 0                   # Initialize the index to 0

    loop:
        beq $t1, 5, end_loop        # Exit loop if index reaches the end
        lw $t2, my_array($t1)      # Load array element into $t2
        add $t0, $t0, $t2          # Add the element to the sum
        sw $t0, my_array($t1)      # Store the prefix sum back in the array
        addi $t1, $t1, 1           # Increment the index
        j loop

    end_loop:
        # $t0 now contains the final prefix sum
```

# Binary Exponentiation in MIPS

## Binary Exponentiation Algorithm
Binary exponentiation is an efficient algorithm to calculate `a^b` for integer `a` and `b`.

## Example Code
```assembly
    .text
    main:
        li $a0, 2            # Base (a)
        li $a1, 10           # Exponent (b)
        li $t0, 1            # Initialize result to 1

    loop:
        beq $a1, $zero, end_loop   # Exit loop if exponent is 0
        andi $t1, $a1, 1          # Check if the lowest bit of the exponent is set
        beq $t1, $zero, even_pow  # If even exponent, go to even_pow
        mul $t0, $t0, $a0         # Multiply result by base (odd exponent)
        j next_pow

    even_pow:
        mul $a0, $a0, $a0         # Square the base (even exponent)

    next_pow:
        srl $a1, $a1, 1           # Shift right to divide the exponent by 2
        j loop

    end_loop:
        # $t0 now contains the result of a^b
```

Certainly, here's a Markdown document that exclusively covers logic and arithmetic instructions in the MIPS architecture:

# MIPS Logic and Arithmetic Instructions

## Introduction
MIPS architecture provides a wide range of logic and arithmetic instructions for data manipulation and computation. These instructions are essential for performing mathematical operations and logical comparisons in assembly language programming.

## Arithmetic Instructions

### `add` - Addition
The `add` instruction adds two values and stores the result in the destination register.

```assembly
add $dest, $src1, $src2   # $dest = $src1 + $src2
```

### `sub` - Subtraction
The `sub` instruction subtracts one value from another and stores the result in the destination register.

```assembly
sub $dest, $src1, $src2   # $dest = $src1 - $src2
```

### `mul` - Multiplication
The `mul` instruction multiplies two values and stores the result in the destination registers. The high-order bits of the result are stored in the destination register specified and the low-order bits in the next register.

```assembly
mul $dest_hi, $dest_lo, $src1, $src2   # $dest_hi:$dest_lo = $src1 * $src2
```

### `div` - Division
The `div` instruction divides one value by another and stores the quotient in the destination register specified and the remainder in the next register.

```assembly
div $dest, $src1, $src2   # $dest = $src1 / $src2
```

## Logical Instructions

### `and` - Bitwise AND
The `and` instruction performs a bitwise AND operation between two values and stores the result in the destination register.

```assembly
and $dest, $src1, $src2   # $dest = $src1 & $src2
```

### `or` - Bitwise OR
The `or` instruction performs a bitwise OR operation between two values and stores the result in the destination register.

```assembly
or $dest, $src1, $src2   # $dest = $src1 | $src2
```

### `xor` - Bitwise XOR
The `xor` instruction performs a bitwise XOR operation between two values and stores the result in the destination register.

```assembly
xor $dest, $src1, $src2   # $dest = $src1 ^ $src2
```

### `nor` - Bitwise NOR
The `nor` instruction performs a bitwise NOR operation between two values and stores the result in the destination register.

```assembly
nor $dest, $src1, $src2   # $dest = ~($src1 | $src2)
```

### `slt` - Set Less Than
The `slt` instruction compares two values and sets the destination register to 1 if the first value is less than the second, otherwise, it sets it to 0.

```assembly
slt $dest, $src1, $src2   # $dest = ($src1 < $src2) ? 1 : 0
```

### `sltu` - Set Less Than Unsigned
The `sltu` instruction compares two values as unsigned integers and sets the destination register to 1 if the first value is less than the second, otherwise, it sets it to 0.

```assembly
sltu $dest, $src1, $src2   # $dest = ($src1 < $src2) ? 1 : 0 (unsigned)
```

These are some of the fundamental arithmetic and logic instructions available in the MIPS architecture. They are essential for performing mathematical calculations and making logical decisions in MIPS assembly language programming.
