Certainly, let's expand on the MIPS architecture document to cover arrays, prefix sums, and binary exponentiation as well.

# MIPS Architecture Overview

## Introduction
MIPS (Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages) is a popular RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture known for its simplicity and efficiency. It is widely used in various applications, including embedded systems, gaming consoles, and more.

## MIPS Registers
MIPS architecture includes 32 general-purpose registers (R0-R31), each 32 bits in size. These registers are used for data manipulation and control flow.

## Instruction Formats
MIPS instructions come in three primary formats:
1. R-Format: Used for arithmetic and logical operations.
2. I-Format: Used for immediate values and memory operations.
3. J-Format: Used for jump instructions.

## Addressing Modes
MIPS supports various addressing modes, including direct, indirect, and indexed addressing.

# MIPS Instruction Set

## Arithmetic Instructions
MIPS provides a wide range of arithmetic instructions, including add, sub, mul, div, and more.

## Logical Instructions
Logical instructions include and, or, xor, and shift operations (sll, srl, etc.).

## Memory Access Instructions
Instructions like lw (load word) and sw (store word) are used for memory access.

## Control Flow Instructions
MIPS offers conditional branches (beq, bne) and unconditional jumps (j, jal) for control flow.

# MIPS Assembly Language

## Assembly Syntax
MIPS assembly language uses a simple and consistent syntax, with mnemonic instructions followed by operands.

## Example Code
```assembly
    addi $t0, $zero, 10     # Load immediate value 10 into $t0
    addi $t1, $zero, 20     # Load immediate value 20 into $t1
    add  $t2, $t0, $t1      # Add $t0 and $t1, store result in $t2
```

## Comments
Comments in MIPS assembly are denoted by `#` and are used for documentation.

# MIPS Exception and Interrupt Handling

## Exception Handling
MIPS architecture provides mechanisms for handling exceptions such as divide-by-zero and overflow.

## Syscalls in MIPS (qtSpim)
qtSpim is a popular MIPS simulator that allows you to interact with the system. Syscalls are used to perform I/O operations and interact with the simulator. Some commonly used syscalls include:
- `li $v0, <syscall_number>`: Load the syscall number into register `$v0`.
- `syscall`: Trigger the syscall based on the value in `$v0`.

Here are some common syscall numbers:
- 1: Print integer
- 4: Print string
- 5: Read integer
- 8: Read string
- 10: Exit

# Working with Arrays in MIPS

## Array Declaration
To declare an array in MIPS, you can use the `.data` section to allocate memory for it.

```assembly
    .data
    my_array: .word 0:100   # Declare an integer array of size 100, initialized with zeros
```

## Accessing Array Elements
You can access array elements by using base address and indexing.

```assembly
    lw $t0, my_array($t1)   # Load the value at my_array[index] into $t0
```

# Prefix Sum in MIPS

## Prefix Sum Algorithm
A prefix sum, or cumulative sum, of an array is a new array where each element is the sum of all preceding elements in the original array.

## Example Code
```assembly
    .data
    my_array: .word 1, 2, 3, 4, 5   # Example array
    .text
    main:
        li $t0, 0                   # Initialize the sum to 0
        li $t1, 0                   # Initialize the index to 0

    loop:
        beq $t1, 5, end_loop        # Exit loop if index reaches the end
        lw $t2, my_array($t1)      # Load array element into $t2
        add $t0, $t0, $t2          # Add the element to the sum
        sw $t0, my_array($t1)      # Store the prefix sum back in the array
        addi $t1, $t1, 1           # Increment the index
        j loop

    end_loop:
        # $t0 now contains the final prefix sum
```

# Binary Exponentiation in MIPS

## Binary Exponentiation Algorithm
Binary exponentiation is an efficient algorithm to calculate `a^b` for integer `a` and `b`.

## Example Code
```assembly
    .text
    main:
        li $a0, 2            # Base (a)
        li $a1, 10           # Exponent (b)
        li $t0, 1            # Initialize result to 1

    loop:
        beq $a1, $zero, end_loop   # Exit loop if exponent is 0
        andi $t1, $a1, 1          # Check if the lowest bit of the exponent is set
        beq $t1, $zero, even_pow  # If even exponent, go to even_pow
        mul $t0, $t0, $a0         # Multiply result by base (odd exponent)
        j next_pow

    even_pow:
        mul $a0, $a0, $a0         # Square the base (even exponent)

    next_pow:
        srl $a1, $a1, 1           # Shift right to divide the exponent by 2
        j loop

    end_loop:
        # $t0 now contains the result of a^b
```
